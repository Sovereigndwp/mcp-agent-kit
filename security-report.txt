The popular Reckless plugin suite also received key updates, extending its utility for node operators looking to customize or experiment at the edges of Lightning&#x2019;s capabilities.</p><p>One of the most notable enhancements was early support for the Lightning Service Provider Specification (LSPS), marking an important step toward improving liquidity provisioning and interoperability between LSPs and wallets. The release also enabled peer storage by default, making it easier for developers and power users to manage metadata associated with channel peers across restarts and deployments.</p><p>As Bitcoin&#x2019;s scalability layer continues to evolve, Core Lightning remains focused on delivering a modular, production-ready implementation tailored to real-world use.

DahLIAS introduces 64-byte aggregate signatures with two-round signing and nearly double the verification speed of half-aggregated Schnorr, marking a potential leap forward in transaction efficiency and scalability.</p><p>At the Real World Crypto conference in Bulgaria, Research Lead Jonas Nick <a href=\"https://x.com/n1ckler/status/1932459144490987954?ref=blog.blockstream.com\">presented</a> ChillDKG, a draft BIP proposing a simpler and more secure approach to Distributed Key Generation (DKG) for threshold wallets, long a stumbling block in multi-party signing schemes. ChillDKG could pave the way for wider adoption of robust multisig protocols like FROST.</p><p>Also at Bitcoin 2025, Jonas shared a <a href=\"https://x.com/Blockstream/status/1945981475922518058?ref=blog.blockstream.com\">first look</a> at Shielded CSV, a new privacy-preserving upgrade built with collaborators from Alpen Labs and ZeroSync. Shielded CSV aims to enhance Bitcoin&#x2019;s privacy model by enabling verifiable yet opaque spending conditions, an elegant step toward better confidentiality at the protocol level.</p><p>The programming language subgroup of Blockstream Research also made meaningful progress in Q2 releasing new tooling for <a href=\"https://simplicity-lang.org/?ref=blog.blockstream.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Simplicity</a>, including the <a href=\"https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/hal-simplicity/?ref=blog.blockstream.com\">hal-simplicity</a> CLI tool, as well as finalizing &#x201C;SimplicityHL&#x201D; as the official name for its high-level language, previously known by the codename Simfony.

The popular Reckless plugin suite also received key updates, extending its utility for node operators looking to customize or experiment at the edges of Lightning&#x2019;s capabilities.</p><p>One of the most notable enhancements was early support for the Lightning Service Provider Specification (LSPS), marking an important step toward improving liquidity provisioning and interoperability between LSPs and wallets. The release also enabled peer storage by default, making it easier for developers and power users to manage metadata associated with channel peers across restarts and deployments.</p><p>As Bitcoin&#x2019;s scalability layer continues to evolve, Core Lightning remains focused on delivering a modular, production-ready implementation tailored to real-world use.

The popular Reckless plugin suite also received key updates, extending its utility for node operators looking to customize or experiment at the edges of Lightning&#x2019;s capabilities.</p><p>One of the most notable enhancements was early support for the Lightning Service Provider Specification (LSPS), marking an important step toward improving liquidity provisioning and interoperability between LSPs and wallets. The release also enabled peer storage by default, making it easier for developers and power users to manage metadata associated with channel peers across restarts and deployments.</p><p>As Bitcoin&#x2019;s scalability layer continues to evolve, Core Lightning remains focused on delivering a modular, production-ready implementation tailored to real-world use.

# Bitcoin Mining Explained

Bitcoin mining is the process that secures the network and processes transactions. Think of miners as the auditors and security guards of Bitcoin.

## How Mining Works

Miners compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles. The first to solve it gets to add the next block to the blockchain and receives a reward.

## Why Mining Matters

Without miners, Bitcoin wouldn't work. They:
- Validate every transaction
- Secure the network from attacks  
- Issue new Bitcoin according to the protocol rules

The more miners participate, the more secure Bitcoin becomes. It's like having more guards protecting a valuable treasure - the treasure becomes safer as more trusted guards are added.

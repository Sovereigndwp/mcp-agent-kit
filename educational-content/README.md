### Bitcoin First Principles Interactive Course

**File:** `bitcoin-course/bitcoin-first-principles.html`

An comprehensive interactive educational platform that teaches Bitcoin from the ground up using first principles thinking.

#### ðŸŽ¯ Course Overview

This course takes learners through 8 progressive principles that build logically on each other:

1. **The Double-Spending Problem** - The fundamental challenge Bitcoin solves
2. **The Trust Problem** - Why centralized systems fail
3. **The Consensus Problem** - How strangers agree on truth
4. **Proof of Work** - Making votes expensive to prevent attacks
5. **The Chain Structure** - Creating immutable transaction history
6. **Digital Signatures** - Proving ownership without revealing secrets
7. **Economic Incentives** - Making honesty profitable
8. **Network Effects** - Why Bitcoin grows stronger over time

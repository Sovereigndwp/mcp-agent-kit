### **2. Enhance Socratic Question Quality**

**Template for High-Quality Socratic Questions:**

```markdown
## Bitcoin Transaction Fees Module

### Tier 1 Questions (Discovery)
- "You want to send $20 in Bitcoin to a friend, but the fee is $15. What does this tell you about the Bitcoin network right now?"
- "If 10,000 people try to send Bitcoin at the same time, what do you think happens to transaction fees?"

### Tier 2 Questions (Analysis) 
- "A Bitcoin transaction from 2010 cost almost nothing. The same transaction today costs $3. What changed and why?"
- "Lightning Network transactions cost fractions of pennies. What does this suggest about different approaches to scaling Bitcoin?"

### Tier 3 Questions (Synthesis)
- "If you were designing a money system from scratch, how would you balance speed, cost, and security?"
- "How might Bitcoin transaction fees in 2030 differ from today, and what would drive those changes?"
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create question bank database with 200+ categorized questions
2. Implement question difficulty progression algorithm  
3. Add context-aware question selection based on student responses
4. Create question effectiveness tracking system

### **3. Implement Proper Assessment Framework**

**Multi-Level Assessment System:**

```javascript
// Assessment Configuration
const assessmentFramework = {
  formative: {
    frequency: 'every_module',
    types: ['socratic_dialogue', 'concept_check', 'peer_discussion'],
    weight: 30
  },
  summative: {
    frequency: 'end_of_course',
    types: ['practical_project', 'case_study_analysis'],
    weight: 70
  },
  adaptive: {
    difficulty_adjustment: true,
    personalized_feedback: true,
    remediation_paths: true
  }
}
```

**Assessment Templates:**

```markdown
### Module 1: Transaction Fees Assessment

**Scenario-Based Question:**
"Sarah needs to send Bitcoin urgently during a network congestion period. She has three options:
- Pay 50 sat/vB and wait potentially 6+ hours
- Pay 100 sat/vB and likely confirm within 1 hour  
- Use Lightning Network for instant, cheap transfer

Walk through her decision-making process. What factors should she consider?"

**Evaluation Rubric:**

2. Generate new wallet and backup seed phrase
3. Receive testnet Bitcoin from faucet

**Discovery Phase (15 minutes):**
1. Try to recover wallet using seed phrase
2. Create second wallet and send transaction between them
3. Export public key and analyze transaction on block explorer

**Challenge Phase (20 minutes):**
1. Set up 2-of-3 multisig wallet
2. Practice signing transaction with multiple keys
3. Calculate fees for different transaction types

**Reflection Questions:**
- What happened when you tried to send with insufficient funds?
- How did the seed phrase recovery process feel emotionally?
- What would happen if you lost one key in the multisig setup?

**Real-World Connection:**
"Now imagine this is $10,000 of your actual Bitcoin. What additional precautions would you take?"
```

**Implementation Tools:**
